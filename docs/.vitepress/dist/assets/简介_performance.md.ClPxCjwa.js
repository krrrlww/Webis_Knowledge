Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-summary" aria-label="Permalink to “3. Summary”">​</a></h2><p>Overall, Webis achieves a good balance between performance and usability. It is competitive in terms of speed and precision for static pages and is suitable for tasks requiring rapid deployment and small to medium-scale data extraction. Compared with tools like Trafilatura, Webis&#39;s advantages lie in its lightweight nature and speed, but it still has limitations in dynamic rendering page processing. In the future, if combined with rendering support and stronger semantic models, Webis&#39;s application scenarios will be further expanded.</p>',9)])])}const h=t(o,[["render",n]]);export{g as __pageData,h as default};
