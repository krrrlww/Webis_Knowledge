# Webis Supports Multimodal Data Processing

Webis is a powerful multimodal data cleaning and extraction tool that goes beyond HTML webpage content extraction, enabling comprehensive processing of diverse input formats including PDFs, images, and documents (TXT, MD, DOCX). By integrating advanced tools such as pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, Tesseract, EasyOCR, LangChain, and LlamaIndex, Webis efficiently cleans and extracts structured content from multimodal data, delivering unified, clean outputs (e.g., JSON or plain text) to meet diverse data processing needs. This versatility allows it to excel in complex data pipelines, cross-format content analysis, and high-precision data extraction scenarios.

## Support for PDF, Image, and Document Processing

For PDF files, Webis adopts a dual-engine collaborative architecture with pdfplumber and PyMuPDF to achieve comprehensive, high-performance content extraction. PyMuPDF handles fast and efficient parsing of large PDFs, excelling at extracting text, basic tables, and core metadata (e.g., author, page count, creation date) while fully preserving the original document structure (such as page order and paragraph hierarchy). It is an ideal choice for processing academic papers, lengthy reports, and batch PDFs, especially in scenarios requiring high processing speed. Complementing this, pdfplumber specializes in high-precision extraction of complex table structures, accurately identifying merged cells, nested tables, and refined table formats (e.g., borders, column widths) to ensure table data integrity. This is crucial for financial statements, data-intensive industry reports, and scientific datasets, where the accuracy of tabular data directly impacts downstream analysis results. The collaboration between these two tools balances speed and precision, enabling reliable processing of various PDF layouts.

For image processing, Webis integrates two leading OCR engines—Tesseract and EasyOCR—supporting common raster image formats such as `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, and `.tiff`, covering scenarios including scanned documents, screenshots, and text-containing images. Tesseract offers robust multilingual support and mature recognition capabilities for standard text, while EasyOCR significantly improves accuracy in complex scenarios such as low-resolution images, handwritten text overlays, and multilingual mixed text. Their collaboration ensures reliable text extraction from various image-based sources. Both engines are optimized for Chinese character recognition, fully supporting simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, and Chinese-English mixed text to meet the diverse needs of Chinese-language scenarios.

For document formats, Webis combines LangChain and LlamaIndex to process structured and unstructured content, supporting file types such as `.txt` (plain text), `.md` (Markdown), and `.docx` (Word documents). LlamaIndex specializes in parsing complex document structures, accurately identifying and preserving elements like headings, footers, footnotes, nested lists, and tables of contents to maintain the hierarchical integrity of the original content—critical for preserving contextual relationships in business reports, legal contracts, and academic manuscripts. LangChain enhances the extraction process with advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, supporting semantic chunking (splitting content by logical meaning), key entity extraction (e.g., names, dates, organizations), and context-aware summarization. This enables Webis to go beyond simple text extraction, generating structured, actionable outputs (such as key point summaries or entity-rich data frames), making it an ideal tool for processing text-intensive documents—especially scenarios requiring both structural integrity preservation and deep semantic understanding.

## Integrated Unified Interface

Webis’s multimodal support is built on a unified interface, allowing users to seamlessly process PDF, image, and document data via APIs or CLI without switching tools. Its modular design ensures efficient collaboration between underlying engines, and all extracted data adheres to a consistent structured format—simplifying integration with data analysis pipelines, content aggregation platforms, and business intelligence systems.

In the future, Webis plans to further optimize multimodal processing performance (e.g., accelerating batch processing speed, improving OCR accuracy for low-quality images) and expand support for additional formats (such as video subtitle extraction and audio speech-to-text conversion), evolving into a comprehensive end-to-end multimodal data processing solution.
