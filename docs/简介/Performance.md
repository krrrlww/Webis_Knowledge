# Webis Performance Evaluation

Webis demonstrates **efficient and stable** performance in multimodal data extraction, particularly suitable for quickly extracting structured data. Its main advantages are fast speed, few dependencies, easy integration, and good filtering of noise such as advertisements and navigation bars. This article provides a more detailed explanation of Webis's performance characteristics and compares it horizontally with several common web data extraction tools.

## 1. Performance Characteristics

- **Processing Speed**
  Webis typically completes single-page extraction within hundreds of milliseconds and maintains high throughput for batch processing. Suitable for small to medium-scale data crawling and real-time requirement scenarios.

- **Filtering Capability**
  Can effectively remove common webpage noise (such as advertisements, navigation, sidebars), output clean content, and support JSON or plain text formats.

- **Adaptability**
  - Performs stably on **static HTML pages** with low error rates and good adaptability to various webpage structures.
  - For **JavaScript-rendered dynamic pages**, external tools (such as headless browsers) need to be combined for better results.

- **Lightweight Design**
  Minimizes dependencies, simplifies deployment, can be quickly integrated into existing data pipelines, and is suitable for rapid prototyping.

- **Application Scenarios**
  Suitable for small to medium-scale crawling tasks, rapid verification, and lightweight deployment scenarios; for large-scale tasks requiring complex dynamic webpage processing, it still needs to be combined with other tools.

## 2. Tool Comparison

The following table compares the main features of Webis with several common webpage content extraction tools:

| Tool        | Extraction Precision          | Processing Speed | Dynamic Page Support | Usability / Configuration | Application Scenarios               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Webis**   | High (reliable for static pages) | Fast (millisecond level) | Requires external tools | High (few dependencies)   | Small to medium-scale data crawling, rapid prototyping |
| Trafilatura | High, good structure retention | Medium           | Weak                 | Medium (more dependencies) | Complex page content extraction, research scenarios |
| Goose3      | Medium (better for news)      | Slow             | Weak                 | Medium                    | News page extraction                |
| Newspaper3k | Medium (rich metadata)        | Slower           | Weak                 | Simple and easy to use     | News and blog content extraction    |

## 3. Summary

Overall, Webis achieves a good balance between performance and usability. It is competitive in terms of speed and precision for static pages and is suitable for tasks requiring rapid deployment and small to medium-scale data extraction. Compared with tools like Trafilatura, Webis's advantages lie in its lightweight nature and speed, but it still has limitations in dynamic rendering page processing. In the future, if combined with rendering support and stronger semantic models, Webis's application scenarios will be further expanded.
